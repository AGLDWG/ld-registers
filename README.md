# LD (Linked Data) Registers
A few PHP files delivering content of the [Australian Government Linked Data Working Group](http://www.linked.data.gov.au)'s as Linked Data, that is as both HTML & RDF, according to the [Content Negotiation by Profile](https://www.w3.org/TR/dx-prof-conneg/) specification.

The three registers are:

1. <http://linked.data.gov.au/dataset/> - Linked Data Datasets  
2. <http://linked.data.gov.au/def/> - Definitional Items (vocabularies, ontologies)  
3. <http://linked.data.gov.au/org/> - Organisations

The content for the three registers is sourced from the AGLDWG's catalogue, see <http://catalogue.linked.data.gov.au/dataset/>. The code here just interprets data from the catalogue into supported *profiles* and *Media Types* (formats).
